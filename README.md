# Worm

Worm is a version of the classic 'snake' game, written in go.

## Features

* uses UTF-8 chars to make things nicer (caveat: needs a terminal and font, appropriately supporting it)
* features a 'wrapped' board (worm emerges on the other side, when it crosses the border), like  back in the 80's
* board size can be adapted during play (comes in handy, when worm gets faster & longer)
* comes with animated rolling counter, as nostalgic reminder on, how software used to be distributed back in the days (go look it up kids!)
* instruction screen
* pause mode
